Copy the assemblies from Sitecore XP 8 to the "Components" folder in the solution root
NuGet package restore is used for other dependencies

Deployment to Sitecore install:
1)  Open "src\ExperienceGenerator.Client\App_Config\Include\ExperienceGenerator\zExperienceGenerator.DevSettings.config" and change "experienceGeneratorSource" variable to xGenerator source location
2) Open "src\publishsettings.targets" and change publishUrl to the Sitecore host name
3) Perform Web publish for all web projects in solution using "local" profile
4) Go to the %isntanceName%/unicorn.aspx page and synchronize "ExperienceGenerator" configuration 

Building the installation package requires Sitecore Rocks.
The package definition is in ExperienceGenerator.Client\ExperienceGenerator.package. You need to point it to a Sitecore install with Experience Generator installed to build the package.
