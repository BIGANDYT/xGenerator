Copy the assemblies from Sitecore XP 8.0 to the "Components" folder in the solution root
NuGet package is restored for other dependencies

Deployment to Sitecore install:
Install the package from ExperienceGenerator.Client\ExperienceGenerator.zip to create the items

Copy ExperienceGenerator.Client\App_Config\* to the root of the installation
Copy Colossus.Integration\App_Config\* to the root of the installation
Copy all non-Sitecore assemblies from ExperienceGenerator.Client\bin to the bin folder of the installation (i.e. those not already there)


To verify deployment, try opening /api/xgen/options. 
If these gives an 404 or is blank try:
1. Stop IIS
2. Delete all folders in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root
3. Start IIS


Building the installation package requires Sitecore Rocks.
The package definition is in ExperienceGenerator.Client\ExperienceGenerator.package. You need to point it to a Sitecore install with Experience Generator installed.
